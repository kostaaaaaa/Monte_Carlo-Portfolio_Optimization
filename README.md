# Monte_Carlo-Portfolio_Optimization

## Goal 
A small visualization project that uses Monte Carlo simulations to showcase **Volatility**, **Expected Return**, **Sharpe Ratio** of various tickers and protfolios. Leverging historical price data from the yfinance python package and later visualized using Plotly. 

- **Features:**
  - An interactive 3D scatter plot that showcases volatility, return and sharpe ratio and allows users to click on specific scatter points to display the specific portfolio weights and other key metrics for said portfolio.
  - Customization of tickers when running the run_simulation.py file, or use a preselected list of tickers by inputting "default".
